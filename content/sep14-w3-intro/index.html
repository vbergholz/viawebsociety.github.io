        <p>A place where students who are interested in the World Wide Web can meet and talk.</p>
        <p>A lot like a user group (check it out on Wikipedia), but specifically for VIA students.</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          <li>Just read the page and wing it!</li>
          <li>Add something about how I'd like to see a web community sprout up at VIA and maybe even in Horsens.</li>

          <h3>Codecademy</h3>
          <p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com">www.codecademy.com</a></p>
          <img src="images/codecademy.png" alt="">
          <p>A free interactive training resource for web languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and jQuery), PHP, Ruby and Python. A highly recommended starting point, but also a good place to refresh if you need to look at the basics again.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Really stress that this is a great starting place</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Codepen</h3>
          <p><a href="www.codepen.io">www.codepen.io</a></p>
          <img src="images/codepen.png" alt="">
          <p>A free online code editor, where you can enter HTML, CSS and JS code and see the results immediately. Additionally, a thriving community where you can look at (and fork!) others' code as well as share your own.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>There are a few other web apps like this - plnkr is a personal favorite - but Codepen is great for the community and to see other people's code</p>

          <h3>Mozilla Developer Network</h3>
          <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web</a></p>
          <img src="images/mozilladocs.png" alt="">
          <p>An extensive and community-built collection of documentation, ranging from A-Z references for HTML/CSS/JS, to in-depth guides and tutorials. Has resources for beginners (especially the tutorials) all the way up to professionals (especially the references).</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>For most things, this is the only resource you'll need. The HTML and CSS references are amazing and there really aren't alternatives.</p>
          </aside>

          <h3>Shoptalk</h3>
          <p><a href="shoptalkshow.com">shoptalkshow.com</a></p>
          <img src="images/shoptalk.png" alt="">
          <p>A weekly podcast hosted by Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert, two well-known and highly respected experts in web design and development. They often interview other influential web people, and answer listener-submitted questions in every show.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Might get a little too technical for beginners, but stick with it!</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Web Platform Docs</h3>
          <p><a href="www.webplatform.org">www.webplatform.org</a></p>
          <img src="images/webplatformdocs.png" alt="">
          <p>Community-made reference guides to web languages and practices, officially organized and sanctioned by the W3C. Still new and under construction, so keep using the Mozilla docs for now.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Standards at the W3C</h3>
          <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">www.w3.org/TR/</a></p>
          <img src="images/webstandards.png" alt="">
          <p>The official standards behind web languages and technologies. Contains all past, present and future (proposed) standards. Most of the documents are surprisingly readable, but this is primarily a resource for professionals and experts. Worth checking out if you really want/need to know how things work "under the hood"</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When you feel like you're ready, w3.org is a great place to start spending time</p>

          <h3>Warning: W3Schools</h3>
          <img src="images/w3schools.png">
          <p><b>Be warned: </b>This site is maintained by unknown people, and the information it provides is often incorrect or poor practice. It is widely criticized in the web community (see for example w3fools.com). Do not mistake it for the W3C.</p>
          <p><b>Bottom line: </b>There are many terrific resources out there, created by well-known experts or by communities of professional developers. Avoid W3Schools, and if you do ever use it, take whatever you find there with a grain of salt.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The thing I like most about the web is the community. People are really open about who they are, what they do and how they do it. It's really rare - and really suspicious - when someone keeps things closed and secretive like whoever makes w3schools does.
